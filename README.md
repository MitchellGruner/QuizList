## QuizList

A quiz game in React.js that allows users to answer questions based on random questions given to them. The highest score is kept track of, and the user can keep playing until a question has been incorrectly answered. This project utilizes a trivia API, and is replaced with new questions whenever a user refreshes their page, or a new game is played.

## How It's Made

### Tech used: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:

This project tested my abilities to successfully import data from an API, and display this inforation to the end-user. Also, I learned about session-based storing, as the high score of a user is kept throughout. I learned many React.js properties, such as utilizing the virtual DOM by automatically updating the state whenever an action is performed (if a user's guess is correct, the emoji changes, the question disappears, and the score is updated.
